# Privacy Policy for AeThex Sentinel & Warden

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## 1. Introduction
AeThex Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") provides the Warden Shield extension and Sentinel platform (the "Service"). This policy describes how we collect, use, and process your data. Our core mission is **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**. We process your data solely to protect it from unauthorized exposure.

## 2. Data We Collect
To provide real-time security scanning, the Service processes the following:
* **User Input & Website Content:** We scan text entered into input fields (e.g., forms, chat boxes) on the websites you visit to detect sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII).
* **Authentication Information:** We store your session token (JWT) to verify your identity and sync your security settings.
* **Financial & Personal Information:** We temporarily process patterns resembling credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other PII solely to redact or block them.
* **User Activity:** We monitor specific browser events (paste, submit) to prevent data leakage.
* **Device Data:** We collect your IP address to enforce location-based security policies (e.g., geofencing).

## 3. How We Use Your Data
**We do not sell your data.** We use the data strictly for:
1.  **Real-Time Scrubbing:** Detecting and masking sensitive data before it leaves your browser.
2.  **Security Alerting:** Notifying you if your credentials have been compromised or if you are visiting a flagged phishing site.
3.  **Policy Enforcement:** Verifying your "Passport" status to grant access to specific communities or tools.

## 4. Data Retention
* **Scanned Text:** Text input is processed in volatile memory and is **not stored** on our servers unless a security violation (e.g., attempting to leak a ban word) is triggered.
* **Violation Logs:** If a violation occurs, we store a redacted log of the event (User ID, Timestamp, Rule Broken) for audit purposes.
* **Account Data:** Your profile data is retained as long as your account is active.

## 5. Third-Party Sharing
We do not share data with third parties except:
* To comply with valid legal processes (e.g., subpoenas).
* To protect the security and integrity of the AeThex ecosystem (e.g., reporting abuse).
